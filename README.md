This was a rather satisfying project for me. I am begining to get comfortable in getting lost in the process and also figuring out a way to get things done. All the different tools we have learnt so far having been duely utilized in this project. While it might not be the best just yet, it has strenghtend my confidence and I am happy with how far we've come.

I utilized resources from w3school, MDN and random google searches. I also had lots of help from my two amazing instructors Joe and Manny ( you guys are the best!) They helped me narrow my vision, while constantly reassuring me that I can actually get things done.

I will keep practicing and making lots of mistakes..smiles!!, now I understand that mistake is absolutely part of the learning process.
